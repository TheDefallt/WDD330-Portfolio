    <h1>Week 1</h1>
    
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>Place primary controls like menus within the easy to reach areas of the one handed grip. Move menus to the bottom to increase reachability.
    The hamburger menu is readily recognized. Menu with a boarder around it gives it a button appearance and is more recognizable to the user.</p>
    
    <p>Make for mobile first reduces cognative load and makes things easier to use. Mobile forces us to focus on what is important. Add labels in the input fields instead.
    Make them float labels. Larger checkboxes are better than small ones. Only give user input that is needed. If they only want phone contanct, only ask for their phone number.
    Make form steps with a progress bar? Pagination is a good idea. Autocomplete on your forms is a good idea as well. Keeps user from abandoning form and eliminates errors.
    Temporarily show passwords. Prevents support calls. Show passwords by default, but give option to hide.
    
    Progress in one bar is a good idea. Space apart long numbers automatically.
    
    Present user with best keyboard for data input. Present number keyboard when only numbers are needed.
    
    Don't use pop ups everyone hates them. Don't autoplay videos or audio
    
    Don't cram too many ads on a page. Bar adds between text is good. Make them get larger when clicked. Videos work better than stills. Ad can show up behind text and be viewed
    through a small window.</p>
