    <h1>Notes</h1>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Place primary controls like menus within the easy to reach areas of the one handed grip.Move menus to the bottom to increase reachability.
        </li>
        <li>
            The hamburger menu is not as readily recognized as we think. The text Menu with a boarder around it gives it a button appearance and is more recognizable to the user.
        </li>
        <li>
            Make for mobile first reduces cognative load and makes things easier to use. Mobile forces us to focus on what is important.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add placeholders in the input fields instead of labels to the side. Making them float labels is even better because the user remebers what information they are typing.
        </li>
        <li>
            Larger checkboxes are better than small ones.
        </li>
        <li>
            Only request user input that is needed. If they only want phone contanct, only ask for their phone number not email or street address.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pagination is better than one long page.
        </li>
        <li>
            Make forms have steps with a progress bar if a paginated for is needed. Autocomplete on your forms is a good idea as well. Keeps user from abandoning form and eliminates errors.
        </li>
        <li>
            Temporarily show passwords. Prevents support calls. Show passwords by default, but give option to hide.
        </li>
        <li>
            If possible see if progressing through the form with only one input box will work. Space apart long numbers automatically like phone or credit card numbers.
        </li>
        <li>
            Present user with best keyboard for data input. Present number keyboard when only numbers are needed.
        </li>
        <li>
            If you plan on using ads, don't use pop ups everyone hates them. Don't autoplay videos or audio either.
        </li>
        <li>
            Don't cram too many ads on a page. Bar adds between text is better.
        </li>
        <li>
            Make them get larger when clicked. Videos work better than stills. Ad can show up behind text and be viewed through a small window.
        </li>
    </ul>
