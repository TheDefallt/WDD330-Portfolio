    <h1>Migraine Weather Assistant - Proposal</h1>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Purpose:
            <p>Help determine if weather changes (specifically atmospheric pressure) are a factor in my wifeâ€™s migraines.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            Audience:
            <p>Migraine sufferers who feel that weather may be an influencine factor in their regularly occuring migraines.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            Data Sources:
            <p>I will be using the OpenWeather API that I found while researching this project. I like it because it returns current and past weather data.
                I can use this data to track changes in temperature, pressure, and other weather factors that may influence how often or possilbly how severe
                a migraine might be
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            Weekly Schedule:
            <p>Week 10 - Setup wireframe of main app page, test api retrieval.</p>
            <p>Week 11 - Put in mathematical logic to show historical changes from the moment a user has a migraine. Possibly add an optional unit conversion feature.</p>
            <p>Week 12 - Add styling</p>
            <p>Week 13 - Perform mobile testing to see if the app can work automatically based on user location.</p>
            <p>Week 14 - Finalize and add error handling.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
