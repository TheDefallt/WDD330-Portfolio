    <ul>

            Errors fall into three categories: System error (A problem with the system or external devices), 
            Programmer error (The program contains incorrect syntax or faulty logic, possibly a typo)
            User error (User has entered incorrect data)
        </li>
        <li>
            Exceptions are errors that return a value that can help diagnose the core issue. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Stack Traces are produced by exceptions to trace back from the point where the error occurs back to the orginal function causing the problem.
        </li>
        <li>
            Warnings give messages about coding errors that don't necessarily prevent the program from running. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Without script mode, Javascript throws far fewer errors which can make it difficult to trace down the exact source of an issue. 
            Adding 'use strict' at the top of your Javascript files will enforce stricter coding practices and therefore generate more errors,
            but code will be cleaner and errors are easier to trace down.
        </li>
        <li>
            Using a Lint tool will also help enforce best practices, but does not garuntee fully functioning code.
        </li>
        <li>
            Alerts and the console are great tools for testing and debugging code.
        </li>
        <li>
            Browsers also come with sets of debugging tools like breakpoints, consoles, and code stepping features to help in the debug process.
        </li>
        <li>
            To ensure programs work as intended, developers can create their own error objects and code in custom exceptions to make sure everything is working 
            correctly. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Jest is another helpful code checking tool
        </li>
