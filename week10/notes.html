    <h2>Client-side for validation</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Never trust data passed to your server from a client. Even if validation is working
            Clients can still alter network traffic.
        </li>
        <li>
            HTML5 form controls come with basic properties like "required" that make sure a neccessary
            field is not left empty."Pattern" uses regular expressions to define which characters are allowed
            or not, and in what order.
        </li>
        <li>
            Javascript can also be used for form validation using the Constraint Validation API
        </li>
        <li>
            Client side validation is more about the user experience than making 100% sure data is valid and not malicious
            Server side validationg is the main defense againt bad data. 
        </li>
    </ul>
