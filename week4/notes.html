            Using WAI-AIRA labels keeps forms keyboard accessible.
        </li>
        <li>
            Forms have their own DOM properties. document.forms returns a collection
            of all the forms on a page. You have to use index numbers to access specific
            forms or refer to them by the name set in the name attribute of the form.

            document.forms[0];

            document.getElementsByTagname('form')[0];

            document.forms.search; -This one requires that the string "search" is set
            in the HTML forms name attribute.
        </li>
        <li>
            form.reset() will reset the form controls back to their original settings
        </li>
        <li>
            New objects can be created without parenthesis if no default arguments are needed
            for the construction.
        </li>
        <li>
            Static methods in classes are called by the class, and not the specific instances.
            Statics cannot be called by specific instances.
        </li>
        <li>
            Prototypes are used to add new properties and methods after the class has been declared.
            They apply to all instances of the class.
        </li>
        <li>
            Monkey-patching is the practice of adding more methods to the built in JavaScript objects like
            Number, String, or Array to gain additional functionality. Prototype is the way to do this.
        </li>
        <li>
            Libraries are addtional packages of code that add additional functionality to JavaScript.
            jQuery, Underscore and Lodash are examples of these.
        </li>
        <li>
            Libraries are useful for quickly gaining functionalty that has been throughly tested by 
            many other people so it is very reliable. On the downside you have to include the libraries along
            with your code so your project will increase in size.
