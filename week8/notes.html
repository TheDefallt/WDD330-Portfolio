            The transform property lets you directly edit the position, scale, rotation, and skew of any element on a page.
        </li>
        <li>
            3D transforms are possible in modern browsers as well
        </li>
        <li>
            Translations, scales, rotations, and skews can also be edited on a single axis. In most cases this is accomplished by editing only one of the arguments in
            a function such as -translate(0, 12px)-, or by using the function that works on that axis specifically -scaleX(1.5)- for example 
        </li>
        <li>
            Because of the cascade functionality of CSS, multiple transforms should be entered in a single transform property as a comma separated list.
            Adding multiple transform properties will cause the lowest ones to overwrite the upper ones. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Transform-orgin is used to change the location of the point on a element where transforms are calculated. Most elements default to the center, but you
            may want to rotate on a corner instead.
        </li>
        <li>
            Transitions can bring eye catching motion to a page. This will cycle through a list of transforms at a user designated speed. Animation are used to further
            edit this functionality and even loop through transitions.
        </li>
    </ul>

            The canvas API gives us the power to use JavaScript to draw and fill any shape that we may need, whether it be simple custom bullet points, or complex professional
            logos.
        </li>
        <li>
            The canvas is an HTML element with opening and closing tabs
        </li>
        <li>
            A context must be designated before drawing can being. 2d is the most common one supported by modern browsers.
        </li>
        <li>
            The canvas coordinate system start in the top left corner of the canvas at (0,0) and end with the maximum size of the canvas on the bottom right.
        </li>
        <li>
            Images, Video, and Text can be added and edited with Canvas as well
        </li>
        <li>
            SVG is a very useful image format as it scales to any size needed without loss of image quality.
        </li>
        <li>
            SVG shapes can be drawn just like drawing on a canvas using SVG tags.
        </li>
        <li>
            Elements are made draggable by setting their draggable property to true. This property however is not a boolean and must be explicitly set to true.
        </li>
