        <li>
            Functions can have methods and properties of thier own.
        </li>
        <li>
            Using the call function allows you to pass objects as the first argument. If more parameters are required, they should be designated after the first 
            object paramenter. The object must always be first.
        </li>
        <li>
            Custom properties are added using dot notation for example, a function with the name addNumbers can have a property named description added in this way,
            addNumbers.description = 'A string describing the function'.
        </li>
        <li>
            Memoization helps cache results of expensive computations so they can just be used again later without needing to compute them again.
        </li>
        <li>
            When using code from others, it may be best to use the "use strict" command on only your code inside an IIFE function
        </li>
        <li>
            Promises can be a better way of managing asynchronous code than using multiple callbacks
        </li>
