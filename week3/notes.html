            Objects are a self-contained set of related values and functions
        </li>
        <li>
            New objects can either be created using curly braces {} or with the new keyword following the object name. The new keyword method will run a contructor method which could be usful if default values are needed.
        </li>
        <li>
            Objects can be nested. You have an object that is a collection of other objects.
        </li>
        <li>
            Objects are copied by reference.
        </li>
        <li>
            Namespacing is useful in larger projects to avoid naming collisions. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Elements can be gotten by many different properties depending on the needs of your project. Id, Tag Name, Class Name are all available options.
        </li>
        <li>
            Hyphanated CSS property names like background-color have to be accessed using camel case since hyphens are not supported in JavaScript. For example backgroundColor.
        </li>
        <li>
            Event listeners can be tied to screen coordinates of an event.
        </li>
